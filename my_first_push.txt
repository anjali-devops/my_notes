Hello everyone, it's Anjali here!
Today, I wanted to share with you all a milestone moment in my journey as a programmer - my first Git push.
dAs someone relatively new to the world of version control, this experience was  ultimately incredibly rewarding.
Let me set the scene for you.
Armed with determination and a strong cup of coffee, I sat down at my computer, ready to take the plunge into the world of Git.
After spending some time familiarizing myself with the basics of Git and GitHub.
I finally felt confident enough to push my first file to a repository.
